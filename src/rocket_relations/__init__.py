"""
This package provides a convenient way to reference common equations for rockets. 
References are from the characteristic velocity and thrust coefficient equations in an ideal rocket:
    * Chamber conditions are created by a constant-pressure heating process
    * Working fluid is a non-reacting, calorically perfect gas
    * Nozzle flow is isentropic
    * Flow is choked at the nozzle throat
    * Flow is steady and quasi-1D
    * Ignore thermal conductivity and viscous or other body forces in the flow
